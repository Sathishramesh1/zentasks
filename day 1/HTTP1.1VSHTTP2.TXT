HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the 
basis for almost all web applications. More specifically, 
HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and 
send information.

What is HTTP/1.1?
* The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it
went through several stages of development, this first version 
of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the
web.
* It uses works on the textual format
* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests 
behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.For better 
understanding, before sending the request and the response there 
is a TCP connection established between client & server. again you
 make a request to the server for image img.jpg & the server gives
a response as an image img.jpg. the connection was not lost here
after the first request because we add a keep-alive header 
which is the part of the request so there is an open connection
between the server & client.
* It compresses data by itself 
Drawbacks 
* there is a persistent connection which means several requests & 
responses are merged in a single connection: 
* The  problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses 
in the plain text message form. 
* The head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all
 other requests until the response does not receive. all the 
 information related to the header file is repeated in every 
 request


What is HTTP/2?
In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. HTTP/2 
solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not 
anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient
 than HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in 
 how it prioritizes content during the loading process.

* It works on the binary protocol.
* It was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the 
  binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the 
  messages in binary format. It works on fully multiplexed that is 
  one TCP connection is used for multiple requests.
* It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for 
  multiple requests.
* It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
* HTTP/2 uses HPACK for data compression,which is used to split 
  data from header, it compresses the header. The server sends 
  all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the 
  client using the PUSH frame.
